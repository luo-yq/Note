Adding an icon to the font file (e.g. for the floating menu)
Go to https://icomoon.io/app/
Go to "Manage Projects" from the menu on the top left.
Use "Import project" and select fonts/selection.json from Jitsi Meet.
Click "load".
Add the new icons using the "Add icons from library" button...
Go to "generate font" and make sure the identifiers for the new icons are correct.
Download the result in a zip file using the "download" button.
Copy selection.json and fonts/jitsi.* from the zip file to fonts/ in Jitsi Meet
Copy the class for the new icon from style.css in the zip file to css/_font.scss in Jitsi Meet (do not copy the whole file)
Copy the selection.json file to react/features/base/font-icons overwriting jitsi.json
